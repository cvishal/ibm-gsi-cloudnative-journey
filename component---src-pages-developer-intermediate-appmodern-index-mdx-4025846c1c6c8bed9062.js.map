However, because of the rapid and broad adoption of container orchestration on Kubernetes platforms across virtually all cloud providers, containerization is usually the better way to move applications to the cloud. At the highest level, containerize means to get the applications that you have today to run in a container.`}</p>\n    <p>{`When you containerize an application, you’re focused on reducing costs, simplifying operations, and streamlining cloud migration to a common Kubernetes platform, such as Red Hat® OpenShift®. You’re also focused on moving toward a single operational model that can be used by both new cloud-native applications and traditional applications. By using the information from Transformation Advisor, you can decide at this phase whether the application can move to a modern, cloud-ready runtime such as IBM® WebSphere® Liberty. Such a move can require code changes and investment from the development team. You can also decide whether the application can move to a container that is based on traditional WebSphere without code changes.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Expose on-premises assets by using APIs`}</h3>\n    <p>{`APIs enable assets that are difficult to enable for the cloud. By externalizing an application with an API, you allow new applications to use the exposed capability in an accessible way. Typically, this activity involves having an OpenAPI-specified REST interface that allows the interface to be discovered and managed. If you externalize the application early in the modernization lifecycle, you insulate consumers from further modernization activities that are done in pursuit of a complete cloud-native implementation.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Refactor the monolith into macroservices`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Refactoring means getting serious about the monolithic things and starting to transform them to become cloud native. Refactoring is where you tackle the huge Java™ and JavaScript files and break monoliths into smaller deployable components as suggested by the programming model. These components are not fully independent microservices from an end-to-end delivery perspective. However, by using this approach, you can decouple modernization paths for individual macroservices and enable the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/code/chunking-strategy-strangler-pattern\"\n      }}>{`Strangler pattern`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Add capabilities as microservices`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Innovate incrementally and establish success early. Enriching an application with new business function is a great way to realize the value from application modernization for cloud. Your application can consume a wide variety of innovative services that are available in the cloud, such as AI, industry, and domain services.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Strangle the monolith`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Incrementally withdraw the monolith from service by replacing functions with new implementations.`}</p>\n    <p>{`An application modernization journey that is container-oriented aligns with the hybrid nature of cloud adoption by large enterprises.
