Use the steps below to help deliver this MVP quickly while following [Garage Method best practices](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/cloud/).\n\n### MVP Statement\n\nAn [MVP](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/practice_minimum_viable_product/) is a [first hill](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/practice_hills/). Here's the hill statement for the MVP we're going to build:\n\n- **Who**: Distribution employees in each of the regional warehouses\n\n- **What**: A secure web application that enables easy access to list of product [SKU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_keeping_unit) inventory levels and inventory locations\n\n- **Wow**: Make the system appealing and easy to use. Deliver it hosted on the IBM Cloud platform. Develop it quickly as a [minimum viable product](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/practice_minimum_viable_product/). Use the latest managed container runtimes and DevOps best practices to enable post MVP feature improvements. Simulate a release to a  _Test_ environment.\n\n## Architecture\n\nWe will build the Micro App using a three-tier microservices architecture. Each tier encapsulates a clean separation of concerns. Each app component will be modelled using _microservices_ and use a number of [polyglot](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/polyglot-programming) programming languages and frameworks. Data will be stored in IBM Cloudant and the Micro App will be secured using IBM App ID.\n\n![Architecture](images/architecture.png)\n\n### User interface\n\nThe Micro App's user interface will look like this [wireframe](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/practice_wireframes/):\n\n![UI Design](/images/inventory-ui-design.png)\n\n### Technical Requirements\nThe Micro App should adhere to the following technical requirements:\n\n- Microservices\n    - Stateless\n    - REST APIs\n    - Polyglot\n- DevOps with CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery)\n    - Monitoring and logging\n    - Code analysis\n    - App security\n- Deployed to Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud or IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service\n- Follow the [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/) user experience\n\n## Guide\n\nYou will approach creating the Micro App bottom up, meaning you will start by creating the backend microservice that manages integration with the data persistence and then build out the digital channel using a backend for frontend pattern. Finally, you will add a web UI to the solution.\n\n### Prebuilt Solution\n\nIf you want to skip the guide and just get the components running, see [Deploy the Inventory App solution](#deploy-the-inventory-app-solution).\n\n\n## Deploy the Inventory App solution\n\nIf you were unable to get everything working, you can deploy the Inventory App solution. \n\n\n### Inventory Services\n\n- Create a new project from the [Inventory Management Service solution template](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/inventory-management-svc-solution/generate)\nnamed `inventory-management-svc-{initials}`\n\n- Clone the repository to your local machine\n\n- Go into the repository directory cloned and execute the following\n\n    ```\n    oc sync dev-{your initials} --dev\n    ```\n\n- Register the pipeline [register the pipeline](/developer-intermediate/deploy-app#register-the-app-in-a-devops-pipeline)\n\n    ```\n    oc pipeline --tekton\n    ```\n\n   replacing `{your initials}` with your actual initials\n\n- Execution of the above command. Give git credentials if prompted, and master as the git branch to use. When prompted for the pipeline, select `igc-java-gradle-v1-2-0`.\n\n- Open the [pipeline to see it running](/developer-intermediate/deploy-app#9.-view-your-application-pipeline)\n\n### Inventory BFF\n\n- Create a new project from the [Inventory Management BFF solution template](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/inventory-management-bff-solution/generate)\nnamed `inventory-management-bff-{initials}`\n\n- Clone the repository to your local machine\n\n- Go into the repository directory cloned and execute `oc sync` command. if you are not executed previously. \n\n- Register the pipeline [register the pipeline](/developer-intermediate/deploy-app#register-the-app-in-a-devops-pipeline)\n\n    ```\n    oc pipeline --tekton\n    ```\n\n   replacing `{your initials}` with your actual initials\n\n- Execution of the above command.
