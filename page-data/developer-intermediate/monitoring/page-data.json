You can skip steps 1-3 about user access, provisioning an instance, and installing an agent.\n\n### Sysdig dashboard\n\nOpen the Sysdig web UI for your environment's cluster\n- [Step 4: Launch the web UI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Sysdig-getting-started#step4) explains how to open the web UI\n    - In the IBM Cloud dashboard, navigate to **Observability** > **Monitoring**\n    - Find the monitoring instance named after your environment's cluster, such as `showcase-dev-iks-sysdig`\n    ![Sysdig Monitoring Instance](sysdig-monitoring-instance.png)\n    - In the monitoring instance, press the **View Sysdig** button to open the Sysdig web UI\n\n### Explore your application\n\nBy default, the Sysdig dashboard opens the **Explore** page on its **Deployments and Pods** grouping.\n\n- Select your cluster\n\nBy default, Sysdig opens its **Overview by Process** dashboard, which has panels showing stats about CPU, memory, and networking.\nThis is one of Sysdig's **Default Dashboards** (i.e. built-in dashboards).\n\nThese are the cumulative totals for all of the pods running in the cluster. Hover over a graph and a key pops up to list\nthe pods and show each one's color.\n\n- Expand your cluster and namespace, then select your deployment\n\nThis shows the stats just for the pods in your deployment.\n\nOn the **Dashboard** page, you can create your own custom dashboards.\n\nThe Getting started tutorial, starting with\n[Step 5: Monitor your environment](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Sysdig-getting-started#step5),\ngives some instructions on monitoring, managing, and what to do next.\n\n\n## Give it a try\n\nBefore you start to understanding how to monitor your application instances, make sure you have [deployed an app](/developer-intermediate/deploy-app) into your development cluster. This _Give it a Try_ uses [template-node-typescript](https://github.com/IBM/template-node-typescript) as an example.\n\nThe **SysDig** service is already created, bound and configured to listen to monitoring metrics and events for your development cluster. You can see this in the HTTP overview.\n\n- Open the **SysDig** instance that is named the same as your development cluster.\n- Go to **Dashboards** > **HTTP Overview**\n\nThe dashboard shows stats for all incoming HTTP requests for all apps in the cluster. Browse through these views to get a feel for what they're showing.\n\n### View your app's metrics\n\nTake a look at the metrics for your app.\n\n- Select the **Explore** page in the left nav menu\n- On the Explore page, select the **Containerized Apps** grouping\n- Search for your app, e.g. `hello-world-mjp`\n- In the list of apps, select yours, e.g. `us.icr.io/mooc-team-one/hello-world-mjp:1.0.0-10`\n- With your app selected, select the **Overview by Container** dashboard\n\n    The Overview by Container dashboard shows metrics for the containers in your app. You will now see just the metrics for your your app. You can view at different levels--from pod to namespace to node to cluster--giving you a fine grain access to you monitoring requirements.\n\n    ![Metrics View](appview.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt's important to be able to monitor your deployed applications.\nHere, the <Globals name=\"env\" /> uses Sysdig Monitoring, but you never had to install or run Sysdig.\nJust deploy your application into the <Globals name=\"env\" /> and it gets moniotored automatically.\nAfter deploying your application, open the Sysdig web UI and browse the status, including the status\nof your cluster as a whole and your deployment in particular.\n\n### Learn more\n\nLearn more about using SysDig Monitoring:\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Sysdig-monitoring\">IBM Cloud Monitoring with Sysdig > Monitoring your environment</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Sysdig-dashboards\">IBM Cloud Monitoring with Sysdig > Working with dashboards</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"https://docs.sysdig.com/en/dashboards.html\">Sysdig Monitor > Dashboards</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"2bd4b4db21e7429d428f2486831d3a5c","counter":748,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Monitoring"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Monitoring\n---\n\nimport Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nUse Sysdig to monitor your running application\n\n</PageDescription>\n\nIn IBM Garage Method, one of the Operate practices is to [automate application monitoring](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/manage/practice_automated_monitoring/).
