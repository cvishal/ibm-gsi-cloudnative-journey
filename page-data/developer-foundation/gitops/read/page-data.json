The process involves automation of the build and validation process and concludes with a new version of the application that is available for promotion to another environment.\n\nContinuous delivery is closely related to continuous deployment. The distinction is:\n- Continuous delivery deploys an application when a user manually triggers deployment\n- Continuous deployment deploys an application automatically when it is ready\n\nAn application is ready for deployment when it passes a set of tests that prove it doesn't contain any significant problems. These tests must be automated so that deployment can be automated. Until you have this set of automated tests and trust them sufficiently, stick with continuous delivery.\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2TTU5BB-k9U\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### Continuous Delivery\n\nContinuous Delivery is the next step for Continuous Integration. The artifacts produced in the Continous Integration stage will be deployed on a production like environment. It is more about making sure that the software is ready to be released and it can be deployed to production like environment at any time.\n\n![cd process](./images/cd_process.png)\n\nDeveloper initially write code to implement a feature or make a change, compile it, and runs all the required tests. If it is running fine and working well, the next thing is to decide the release to the customer. Before doing the release, there are so many things one should take care of. We need to make sure all the configurations are done properly. Respective configuration files should be replaced correctly in the corresponding environments. Also, backups of the previous version of the software should be taken just in case to use them if the system breaks. There may be need to stop some of the services. For example, if your release involves updating the database, you need to stop some of the services which use that database. Also, when this process is done, we need to turn on the maintenance page because we don't want our users to panic seeing this site can't be reached. After doing all this, we test the software and if the tests are all working, we can restart the service we stopped previously.\n\nInitially, we deploy it to staging environment. If everything looks good, we will receive the approval and then we need to deploy it to production like environment. Once you get the approval, we need to do all the steps we did previously again. This process involves so many steps and it is hard to do all of them correctly every time.\n\nTo make lives easier and not to miss any of the steps, automated deployment is necessary. This allows us to deploy more often. Just imagine, if you want to follow all the steps mentioned earlier for every small change, you tend to wait. If we do so and the changes are a lot, then there are more chances of failure and the system may break. So, making the release process automated is very important. By automation, it is easier to deploy smaller changes more frequently. It is also easier to rollback if there is a failure. Moreover, it reduces the overall risk of failure. This allows you to deploy to production like environment at any point of time. To make it possible, the software must all always be in a deliverable state. All your code should be compiled, tested, and the build should succeed.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n- [Sricharan Vadapalli (2018). DevOps: Continuous Delivery, Integration, and Deployment with DevOps.
